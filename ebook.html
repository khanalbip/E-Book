     on a single topic—such as how to find venture capitalists, scale a business,

  <div> <h1>Muna-madan
    मुना-मदन</h1> <br>
  <b>Publisher:
    Oxford International Publication <br>
    Genre:	Poetry <br>
    Language:	Nepali <br>
    Edition:	1st</b> <br>
    <p>
      Muna Madan follows the life of Madan, a Chhetri man from Kathmandu who leaves 
      Muna, his wife, to go to Lhasa to earn a fortune. He is cautioned against 
      leaving by both Muna and his elderly mother, but he decides to leave anyway. 
      While he initially intends to spend just a few weeks in Lhasa, he spends a 
      longer time there, becoming entranced by the city's beauty. He finally sets 
      off for Kathmandu but falls sick with cholera on the way. His travelling 
      companion, Ram, returns to Kathmandu and tells Muna that her husband has died.
But Madan is rescued by a 'Bhote', a Tibetan man. Tibet is called 'Bhot' in the 
Nepali language, drawn from the classical Tibetan name for Tibet, Bod. The Tibetan
nurses Madan back to health, leading Madan to realize that men are great not because
 of their castes but because of their hearts.[1] In the Nepali Hindu caste system,
  a Tibetan, as a meat-eating Buddhist, would have been considered 'untouchable' by
   devout Hindus. The couplet uttered by Madan while touching the Tibetan's feet, a
    sign of great respect in Khas Nepali culture.

  <h1>The Art Of Hapiness</h1> <br> <br>
  
Genre:	Self-help <br>
Language:	English <br>
<p>Nearly every time you see him, he's laughing, or at least smiling. And he makes 
  everyone else around him feel like smiling. He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and 
  temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and a hugely sought-after speaker
   and statesman. Why is he so popular? Even after spending only a few minutes in his 
   presence you can't help feeling happier. If you ask him if he's happy, even though 
   he's suffered the loss of his country, the Dalai Lama will give you an unconditional
    yes. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that 
    the very motion of our life is toward happiness. </p>

  <h1>Atomic Habits</h1>  <br> <br>
  Genre:	Psychology <br>
Language:	English <br>
Published:	2018<br>
<p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every 
  day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals 
  practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad 
  ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.
If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is 
your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want 
to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the 
level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p>
